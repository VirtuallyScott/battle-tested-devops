# Battle-Tested DevOps

Welcome to **Battle-Tested DevOps**, a collection of real-world examples, configurations, and tooling from the trenches of modern infrastructure, cloud-native operations, and security engineering.

This repository is intended to:
- Showcase reference implementations of CI/CD, IaC, and GitOps
- Provide hardened templates for security-conscious environments
- Serve as a portfolio of production-grade configurations
- Help others get up and running fast with opinionated best practices
