# üõ†Ô∏è Battle-Tested DevOps

Welcome to **Battle-Tested DevOps**, a curated portfolio of real-world infrastructure, automation, and security patterns developed and used in production environments by a seasoned DevSecOps/Cloud Engineer.

This repository is **not** another academic collection of hello-world scripts or contrived examples. Everything here is born from the field‚Äîfrom regulated industries, greenfield cloud migrations, enterprise modernization efforts, and the kind of fire drills you only survive with hardened, repeatable processes.

---

## üéØ What This Is

This repo is a growing collection of:

- Infrastructure-as-Code (Terraform, Pulumi) modules used in production environments.
- CI/CD pipeline templates (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins) designed for compliance and velocity.
- GitOps configurations with ArgoCD and Flux for modern Kubernetes deployments.
- DevSecOps examples integrating tools like Trivy, OPA, and Checkov.
- Secure-by-default Dockerfiles, reverse proxy setups, and hardened base configs.
- Scripts and playbooks for system hardening, monitoring, and incident response.
- Observability patterns using Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, and Alertmanager.
- Incident and recovery playbooks from real-world outage responses.
- Modern AI-assisted engineering practices using local and cloud LLMs.
- Compliance and governance implementation strategies for regulated environments.

---

## ‚ö° Who This Is For

- **Hiring managers** and **tech leads** evaluating DevOps candidates.
- **Engineers** looking for solid, no-BS examples to speed up delivery or avoid common mistakes.
- **SREs and platform teams** building secure, reliable internal platforms.
- Anyone tired of fluff and just wants to see how it‚Äôs done in the real world.

## üß† Coming Soon

In addition to what‚Äôs already here, I‚Äôm actively building out:

- Terraform modules for:
  - EKS with IRSA and fine-grained IAM
  - GCP workload identity federation
  - Zero Trust patterns using identity-aware proxies
- GitOps end-to-end example: ArgoCD + SealedSecrets + Kustomize
- Secure Docker + NGINX + OIDC reverse proxy (Okta + Vouch Proxy)
- Chaos testing examples using Litmus or Chaos Mesh
- GitHub Actions CI with staging/production gate logic
- Cloud Custodian policies for automated cloud governance
- Copa for container patching without full image rebuilds
- LLM workflows for infrastructure templating and code generation
- Policy-as-code aligned to CIS/NIST/PCI-DSS benchmarks

## ü§ù About the Author

I‚Äôm a DevSecOps engineer with a background in regulated industries, large-scale infrastructure projects, and cloud-native modernization. Most of these examples come from real-world scenarios‚Äîmigrations, outages, audits, and firefights‚Äîwhere solutions had to work **now**, not just look good in theory.
